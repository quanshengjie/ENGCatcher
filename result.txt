    "text": "The College of Engineering offers several undergraduate minors in various programs. Students must complete this minor form\u00A0with their advisor to complete any minor program\u00A0\nA minor program in aviation is available through the College of the Arts and Sciences.\u00A0 The minor in aviation consists of a minimum of 17 credit hours of required and elective course work.\nMinor Sheet\nArchitecture has a broad cultural impact \u2013 we shape the world and then the world shapes us.\u00A0 The architecture minor addresses a broad audience, students in the arts and sciences as well as those in related disciplines such as construction management and civil engineering.\nMinor Sheet\nThe objective of the BME minor is to provide a focused, educational opportunity in the field of biomedical engineering for students outside of the BME major program. The minor program allows students to choose from one or more BME domains and they are challenged to creatively integrate engineering and life sciences within the context of the domain(s).\u00A0\nMinor Sheet\nCity and regional planners are out-of-the-box thinkers, tomorrow\u2019s innovators who care about everyone\u2019s quality of life.\u00A0 Planners work with communities to foster vital places, so the planning minor suits students majoring in a variety of disciplines as well as those in geography, civil engineering, social work and political science.\nMinor Sheet\nStudents who plan to major in another area but have a strong interest in computing may want to consider a minor in computer and information science (CIS). This minor is appropriate for students who wish to develop skills in software design and development, including programming in C++ or Java.\nMinor Sheet\nA minor in computational science through the Ralph Regula School of Computational Science will provide students who already have expertise in science and engineering with skills complete computationally based projects. Further, the draft competencies created by the participating faculty have been reviewed and approved by a business advisory committee, meaning that when you enter the workforce with this background, you will have the specific skills sought by employers.\nMinor Sheet\nThis minor is designed for non-engineering students interested in learning more about technology\u2019s important role in today\u2019s society. The program is also useful for students who may be working with engineers and technology based opportunities in the future. Specific learning goals include:\nMinor Sheet\nThis program is designed for students from across the university who have an interest in obtaining an introduction to issues such as sustainability, pollution prevention and environmental modeling. Students majoring in chemical and biomolecular engineering, environmental science or policy and management may find this minor beneficial.\nMinor Sheet \nMore Info\nHumanitarian Engineering is the design and creation of products and processes that promote human welfare, especially for the economically disadvantaged or underserved. Examples of humanitarian technologies for developing communities include affordable: t echnologies for clean water and sanitation; n on-polluting lighting, heating, and cooking methods; o ff-grid electricity generation (e.g., solar or bicycle); a gricultural technologies and methods (e.g., aquaponics or irrigation); h ealthcare technologies; and s helters.\nMinor Sheet \nApproved Courses\nThe landscape minor is ideal for students interested in reading and shaping the environment. The curriculum offers a perspective on landscape architecture in relation to urbanization, sustainability, esthetics and social justice. The minor is equally geared toward students from the liberal arts and those in environment, engineering and design majors.\nMinor Sheet\nAny engineering student may apply for an undergraduate minor in nuclear engineering. The undergraduate minor in nuclear engineering requires four core courses and three additional courses selected from a list of options. Up to 10 hours of courses in the minor may be used as technical electives in some majors.\nMinor Sheet\nThis minor program is designed for students within civil engineering who have a professional interest in land surveying and plan to take the FS exam upon completion of the minor.\nMinor Sheet \nMore Info\nThis minor has the goal of allowing students to learn about technology and to become more technologically literate persons. Specific learning goals include:\nMinor Sheet\n",
